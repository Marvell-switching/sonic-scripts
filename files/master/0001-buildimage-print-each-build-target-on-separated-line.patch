Subject: [PATCH 1/6] buildimage: print each build-target on separated line

=== SUMMARY:
Print each build-target on a separated line,
so finally, there is a list of built targets like
[ 01 ] [ target/debs/bookworm/libdashapi_1.0.0_arm64.deb-install ]
[ 01 ] [ target/debs/bookworm/swss_1.0.0_arm64.deb ]
[ 01 ] [ target/python-wheels/bookworm/sonic_bgpcfgd-1.0-py3-none-any.whl ]

NOTE: An original update_screen.sh prints into the PREVIOUS line, so as result
all targets are printed into one same line overriding the previous print.

=== Why this is needed:
- Good for understanding what is built and in which order
- Easy to see which package-versions are used for current build
  and to compare packages with previous builds

== How it is done:
Just use Double Carriage-Return in printf "\n\n" instead of single CR.

== TEST:
Build and see print like
[ 01 ] [ target/debs/bookworm/libdashapi_1.0.0_arm64.deb-install ]
[ 01 ] [ target/debs/bookworm/swss_1.0.0_arm64.deb ]
[ 01 ] [ target/python-wheels/bookworm/sonic_bgpcfgd-1.0-py3-none-any.whl ]
instead of single line
[ 01 ] [ target/python-wheels/bookworm/sonic_bgpcfgd-1.0-py3-none-any.whl ]
